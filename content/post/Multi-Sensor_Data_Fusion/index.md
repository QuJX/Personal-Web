subtitle: Published on IEEE T-ITS, Ocean Engineering, IEEE ITSC, etc.
summary: Reseaching for the perception and fusion of multiple sensors in practical maritime surveillance, including visual, AIS, Radar, GPS, and so on. To achieve the accurate fusion, we proposed the anti-occlusion vessel tracking method, and we are working to fuse their data with graph learning model.
