abstract: With the advancement of maritime unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and deep learning technologies, the application of UAV-based object detection has become increasingly significant in the fields of maritime industry and ocean engineering. Endowed with intelligent sensing capabilities, the maritime UAVs enable effective and efficient maritime surveillance. To further promote the development of maritime UAV-based object detection, this paper provides a comprehensive review of challenges, relative methods, and UAV aerial datasets. Specifically, in this work, we first briefly summarize four challenges for object detection on maritime UAVs, i.e., object feature diversity, device limitation, maritime environment variability, and dataset scarcity. We then focus on computational methods to improve maritime UAV-based object detection performance in terms of scale-aware, small object detection, view-aware, rotated object detection, lightweight methods, and others. Next, we review the UAV aerial image/video datasets and propose a maritime UAV aerial dataset named MS2ship for ship detection. Furthermore, we conduct a series of experiments to present the performance evaluation and robustness analysis of object detection methods on maritime datasets. Eventually, we give the discussion and outlook on future works for maritime UAV-based object detection.
